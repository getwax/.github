## What is WAX?

WAX will be a set of production-ready smart account components providing advanced features that can be easily utilized by wallets, SDKs and dApps.

WAX components are designed to incorporate advanced cryptographic primitives in a secure and intuitive way. The smart contracts use Safe contracts to provide a familiar and battle-tested foundation. Each additional module will be audited, and can be added and removed from the account at the account holders discretion. The accounts can be used directly, or via the 4337 mempool.

The lower level components are brought together in an easy-to-use node module - [EthDK](https://github.com/getwax/ethdk).

## Features

- ✨ Cheaper L2 transactions with BLS Signature aggregation
- 🏗️ Modular smart contract components using battle-tested [Safe modules](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-protocol/modules)
- 📝 ERC 4337 compatible
- 📩 [zk email](https://github.com/zkemail) verification
- 🔑 passkeys verification
- 🔗 Multi-action transactions
- ⛽️ Gasless transactions
- 🔧 Wallet upgradability
